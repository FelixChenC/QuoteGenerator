This is a Litte Quote generator app that display random quote and its author by using the resource from 'https://forismatic.com/en/api/'

The tweet button allow user to tweet the current displaying quote, and the 'Give me a new Quote' button allow user to get another random quote.

very basic but fun practice of JS to render some data from an other API
